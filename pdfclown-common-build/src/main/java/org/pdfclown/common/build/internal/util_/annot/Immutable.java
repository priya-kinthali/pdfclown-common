/**
 * Indicates that the annotated type or type use is immutable.
 * <p>
 * <b>Immutability</b> is about the <i>stability of the externally-observable object state,
 * referenced objects inclusive</i>; it is stricter than {@linkplain UnmodifiableView view
 * unmodifiability} and {@linkplain Unmodifiable real unmodifiability}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Externally-observable state</b> comprises values and object references directly associated to
 * the class, and the objects indirectly associated to the class through object references. Mutable
 * private fields which don't influence the externally-observable state are irrelevant (for example,
 * defensive copy of arrays and other mutable objects makes them effectively immutable;
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> doesn't affect the
 * externally-observable state).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Due to the intrinsic flexibility of interfaces, <i>the semantics of annotated interfaces are much
 * weaker than annotated classes</i>: whilst the latter extend their immutability to derived classes
 * (any additional state MUST be immutable itself), the former are limited to their own definition
 * (derived interfaces and implementing classes may declare additional state as mutable).
 * Consequently, <span class="important">an object referenced as an immutable interface isn't itself
 * immutable, unless the class exposing that reference is immutable or marks its use as
 * immutable</span>: in such case, the class MUST guarantee that the underlying referenced class is
 * immutable itself (that is, the object MUST be <i>effectively immutable</i> — for example, it may
 * declare a {@link java.util.List List} whose actual class is an immutable list from
 * {@link java.util.List#of(Object[]) List.of(...)}). All considered, immutable interfaces are
 * mostly relevant to implementers rather than users, since immutable classes are required to
 * implement only (effectively) immutable interfaces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: <span class="important">This annotation is NOT inheritable, it MUST explicitly mark each
 * and every applicable type.</span> The rationale, beside the fact that immutability does not
 * extend to derived interfaces, is that clarity should win over succinctness.
 * </p>

 * <li>the annotated class has only immutable state (inherited state is also effectively immutable),

 * <li>interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the annotated interface declares only immutable state, whose types are themselves
 * immutable</li>
 * <li>the parents of the annotated interface are themselves immutable</li>
 * <li>the children of the annotated interface MUST honour the immutability of the inherited
 * interface, but can add mutable state of their own</li>
