# Usage

This document describes how to use pdfclown-common in your own projects.

All the examples are based on the Maven build system.

According to your needs, you can choose among these alternatives:

- **release artifacts** — for normal usage
- **snapshot artifacts** — for experimental usage

## Release artifacts

Normally, third-party projects are expected to consume the release versions of this project as dependencies via Maven Central repository.

For the purpose, put the following declaration in the `dependencies` section of your `pom.xml` (replace `%ARTIFACT_ID%` with the identifier of the intended module (for example, `pdfclown-common-util-test`), and `%VERSION%` with the release version of your choice (see [Releases](https://github.com/pdfclown/pdfclown-common/releases))):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.pdfclown</groupId>
  <artifactId>%ARTIFACT_ID%</artifactId>
  <version>%VERSION%</version>
</dependency>
```

## Snapshot artifacts

In case you want to give a try to the latest, unreleased implementation of this project, you can consume SNAPSHOT dependencies (updated on a daily basis) via Maven Central Portal Snapshots repository.

For the purpose:

1. add Maven Central Portal Snapshots repository to your global configuration (`~/.m2/settings.xml`):

    ```xml
    <settings>
      . . .
      <profiles>
        . . .
        <profile>
          <id>central-snapshots</id>
          <repositories>
            <repository>
              <id>central-portal-snapshots</id>
              <name>Central Portal Snapshots</name>
              <url>https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
              <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
              </releases>
              <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
                <checksumPolicy>fail</checksumPolicy>
              </snapshots>
            </repository>
          </repositories>
        </profile>
      </profiles>

      <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>central-snapshots</activeProfile>
      </activeProfiles>
    </settings>
    ```

2. put the following declaration in the `dependencies` section of your `pom.xml` (replace `%ARTIFACT_ID%` with the identifier of the intended module (for example, `pdfclown-common-util-test`), and `%VERSION%` with the current SNAPSHOT version (see `revision` parameter in [maven.config](../.mvn/maven.config))):

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.pdfclown</groupId>
       <artifactId>%ARTIFACT_ID%</artifactId>
       <version>%VERSION%</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

Alternatively, you can build the SNAPSHOT artifacts by yourself: see [Building and Testing](building.md) (in such case, you obviously don't need the Maven Central Portal Snapshots repository).
